# 🔒 Cryptic Secure Communication

## ✨ Project Overview

**Cryptic Secure Communication** is a modern Django-based web application designed for secure file and text encryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) technology. Built with Python, HTML, and CSS, this platform provides end-to-end encryption capabilities for sensitive communications in a user-friendly web interface.

> **Secure by Design, Simple by Implementation**
